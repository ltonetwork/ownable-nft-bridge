# NFT Bridge - Solidity Smart Contracts

## Installation

Install Truffle and Ganache globally

```
sudo npm install -g truffle truffle-plugin-verify ganache-cli
```

Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

## Run tests

```
npm test
```

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file with keys

```
MNEMONIC="..."
INFURA_ID="..."
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY="..."
```

* Deployment to rinkeby is done via [Infura](https://infura.io/).
* Create an [Etherscan API key](https://etherscan.io/myapikey) for contract verification.

_Forks of this project should also modify `config.json`. Decimals aren't considered in the configuration._

## Deployment

### Ganache

[Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) is a personal Ethereum blockchain for development and
tests.

```
npm run migrate -- --network development
```

### Rinkeby

To deploy on the [Rinkeby](https://rinkeby.io/) Ethereum testnet, make sure your wallet has enough ETH to pay for the
GAS.

[Faucet 1](https://testnet.help/en/ethfaucet/rinkeby) | [Faucet 2](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/)

```
npm run migrate -- --network rinkeby
```

You may also want to verify the contract on Etherscan.

```
npm run verify -- --network rinkeby
```

_Verification may fail because of rate limits. Just try again._

### Ethereum mainnet

```
npm run migrate -- --network mainnet
npm run verify -- --network mainnet
```
